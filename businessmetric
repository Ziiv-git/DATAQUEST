NPS is a customer success metric that quantifies customer satisfaction. You've probably been asked to fill in surveys that contained some variation of the question
"How likely are you to recommend this product to a friend?" and whose possible answers were 11 numbers on a scale from 0 to 10.

Customers who pick:

Anything from 0 through 6 are called detractors;
7 or 8 are called passives;
9 or 10 are called promoters;
By proxy each of these categories are gauged as follows:

Detractors: Unhappy customers who share their negative experience with the product or company; they may actively spread negative feedback.

Passives: Customers who may be pleased with the product, but aren't actively promoting it and will quickly turn to the competition if a better opportunity presents itself.

Promoters: Extremely satisfied customers who will act as brand ambassadors.

NPS is then calculated as the percentage of promoters minus the percentage of detractors.
