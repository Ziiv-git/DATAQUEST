A lot of data aren't accessible through data sets or APIs. They may exist on the Internet as Web pages, though. One way to access the data without waiting for the
provider to create an API is to use a technique called Web scraping.

Web scraping allows us to load a Web page into Python and extract the information we want. We can then work with the data using standard analysis tools like pandas
and numpy.

Before we can do Web scraping, we need to understand the structure of the Web page we're working with, then find a way to extract parts of that structure in a
sensible way.
